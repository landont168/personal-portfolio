## Introduction

Hey there, I'm Landon ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a student at the University of Waterloo, pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Finance. This winter, I'm interning at WSIB Ontario as a full-stack developer, honing my frontend skills by helping build an accommodations dashboard for injured workers.

In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with friends, grinding Clash of Clans, and following the latest F1 drama (Lewis Hamilton is my GOAT).

I'm also a firm believer in the idea that a person's music taste can reveal a lot about them, so judge me as you will, as my most listened-to artists in 2024 were Don Toliver, Travis Scott, and Metro Boomin.

### Purpose

I plan to use this journal to hold myself accountable for writing more and better documenting my learnings and experiences â€” something Iâ€™ve neglected in the past.

At the very least, I plan to write monthly posts summarizing random takeaways, challenges, and notable events from the past month â€” whether related to university, internships, projects, or anything else worth reflecting on. Ultimately, I want to be as transparent as possible about my experiences and learnings.

If these posts could offer value to anyone reading, that would also be great.

### 2024 Recap

Since it's better late than never, here are a few of my personal highlights from 2024:

- Interned at Arteria AI during the summer to help the data science team build and test NLP models:

- Developed and deployed my first personal side project, Stockle, using the MERN stack and AWS:

- Attended the SAF Alumni Excellence Gala as a scholarship recipient, where I got to network with alumni and faculty members:

- Built the F1 Mercedes W14 LEGO car as a tribute to Lewis Hamilton leaving Mercedes to join Ferrari:

Anyways, I plan to continue refining this website as I find new ways to improve it (if you're curious, I built this website with TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn). As a fun addition, Iâ€™m also thinking of adding a footnote to each journal post with my favourite song at the time of writing â€” acting as a time capsule.

Iâ€™d also love to connect with new people, so if youâ€™re still reading, feel free to reach out! ðŸ™‚
