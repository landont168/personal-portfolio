## Introduction

Hey there, I'm Landon 👋 

Let me introduce myself! I'm currently a student at the University of Waterloo, pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Finance. For my current winter term, I'm interning at WSIB Ontario as a full-stack developer, honing my frontend skills by building an accommodations dashboard for injured workers.

In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with friends, playing video games, and following the latest F1 drama (Lewis Hamilton is my GOAT).

I'm a firm believer in the idea that a person's music taste reveals a lot about them, so judge me as you will, as my most listened-to artists in 2024 were Don Toliver, Travis Scott, and Metro Boomin.

### Purpose ✍️

I plan to use this journal as a way to hold myself accountable for writing more and documenting my life better — something I’ve neglected in the past. In 2024, for instance, I only took 130 photos and rarely journaled, leaving me unable to recall much of what I did by the end of the year.

At the very least, I plan to write monthly newsletters summarizing key takeaways, accomplishments, challenges, and notable events from the past month — whether related to school, internships, projects, or anything else worth reflecting on.
